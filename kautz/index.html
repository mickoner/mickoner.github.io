  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Kathleen “Kathy” Rejniak, 69, of Yorba Linda passed away peacefully on April 16, 2023.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/kautz.jpg" alt="Kautz" />
<img src="/assets/images/beachk.jpg" alt="Beach Kathy" /></p>

<p>Kathy was born in Detroit, Michigan on October 31, 1953. Her family relocated to Southern California in 1960 where she lived for the next sixty-three years of her life. She graduated from La Mirada High School in 1971. She worked as an operator for Pacific Bell Telephone Company until retiring in 2002.</p>

<p>A devoted mother, Kathy is survived by her children; her son, Michael “Mickey” Rejniak (Monica) of Shell Beach, CA, and her daughter, Sydney Rejniak-Barakat (Omar) of Placentia, CA. She is also survived by her granddaughters, Chloe and Anastasia (Michael), her brothers Daniel of Lancaster, CA; Martin “Marty” (Donna) of Boise, ID; and, John of Yorba Linda, CA, and her sisters Stephanie Borchers of Las Vegas, NV; Sheila Freeman of Monrovia, CA; Barbara Rejniak of Buena Park, CA; and Nancy Bull (Jerry) of Gilbert, AZ, as well as many nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>She was preceded in death by her parents John Martin (1991) and Mary Jane Rejniak (nee Scholie) (1994); her brother William “Bill,” and sister-in-law Janice Rejniak (nee Aud) (2021); her sister Deborah Bryant (2021) and niece Sharla (2002).</p>

<p>Kathy will be missed beyond measure by those who knew and loved her and her one-of-a-kind spirit and personality. She will always be remembered for who she was, and for the unconditional love, unwavering loyalty, and dedication she gave her children and all those she was close to. She will haunt her enemies.</p>

<p>A public visitation is scheduled from 4-8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2nd at Queen of Heaven Mortuary in Rowland Heights, CA. Funeral Mass and Rite of Christian Burial is scheduled at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, May 3rd at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in La Habra followed by graveside committal services and interment at Queen of Heaven Cemetery.</p>
