<p>McMahon uses this, and the next few chapters, to personify what‚Äôs wrong with deal qualification and inspection. He continues with the QBR as the setting to develop his characters who tell the story of how enterprise software sales is screwed up. You have to read the book to appreciate the pyscho-emotional landscape of a business review that McMahon conveys so well. For our purposes, we‚Äôre looking for ops and enablement data lessons.</p>

<p>First up is Shannon. She presents some of her deals in forecast that managers and leaders in the room ask questions while the author interjects commentary that highlights the brokenness of the process. We‚Äôre introduced to the concepts and terms that become the substance of the book later, like Champion and Coach, process and stages. The text portrays a typical deal review with managers and leaders asking a bevy of ad-hoc, reactive, and‚Äìwhat McMahon calls‚Äì‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù questions that receive mostly unsatisying answers. The review ends with the rep, Shannon, calling a forecast amount just below her quota ‚Äúwith a shot at‚Äù full quota. McMahon makes it clear that there‚Äôs nothing substantive about her forecast.</p>

<p>Classic.</p>

<p>Although the book uses a quarterly business review as the setting, some of us have lived this nightmare every week.</p>

<p>Again, the book is setting up context and working to adequately illustrate the problem. We won‚Äôt get too far into solutioning for revenue success and data just yet. But in the spirit of motivating solutions, let‚Äôs call out the obvious problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inaccuracy. There‚Äôs nothing to support the forecasted amount.</li>
  <li>Inefficiency. Even if it was accurate, there‚Äôs way too many words exchanged, time and energy consumed, to get to the simple, object of desire: the forecast.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here were are. Inefficient inaccuracy is the epitome of waste in a business process. Measuring variance and error in predictions is bread-and-butter to data science. McMahon proposes a way to fix all this, and we‚Äôll look at ways to support those fixes because process and data exist at the core of revenue success.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the upcoming chapters where we meet Carlos, Kathleen, and Hannlin, I think it‚Äôs worth the one big lesson from Shannon‚Äôs time at the podium:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consistent format with a minimum expectation of completeness. The deal details should be presented in consistent way. Certain data points should be required. As we work through the book, we‚Äôll fill in what those details should be. This could be a preso template, preferably something that can be generated from CRM details so that reps are not having to type anything twice. But, of course this would mean that the information is already in the CRM.</li>

<p>OK, stay with me here. We‚Äôre still in the QBR. This is like a sales soap opera episode. Carlos is the rep presenting. With this character the book introduces us to a glimpse of what ‚Äúgood‚Äù could look like as a seller forecasting their number. ‚ÄúThis was one rep I admired,‚Äù McMahon writes. He is firm in what he is forecasting although it is well below the quota and the managers put on pressure for him to increase it. He knows where his deals stand and where some of his blind spots are.</p>

<p>The lesson of this chapter is sandbagging, when reps commit to a lower number than they have high confidence that they can deliver, i.e., promise low, deliver high. But more often, they‚Äôre compelled to forecast high and end up dropping the commit at the end of the quarter. This serves no one well, except maybe the sales leader. Like a warm bed on a cold morning, you know you have to face it, but you put off the discomfort as long as you can.</p>

<p>Rev success data lessons? How does Carlos know more about his deals than Shannon? And how do we make sure what Carlos knows is captured consistently so that all the reps have the same confidence in their forecast?</p>

<p>The problem here is consistency and alignment. There‚Äôs no consistent qualification understanding between two reps. There‚Äôs no alignment between rep and manager. There‚Äôs no agreement on how to call balls and strikes. There‚Äôs just guts and bias and prejudice.</p>

<p>Again, this is the just the setup. Answers come, but for now, let‚Äôs just appreciate the questions and what the problem looks like. We‚Äôve got, like, 54 more chapters to get through. üòú</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="qsl_for_revsuccess" /><category term="revenue_success" /><category term="sales" /><category term="revenue" /><category term="gtm" /><category term="qsl" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Carlos]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Revenue Success</title><link href="https://www.rejniak.com/revenue_success/2023/05/08/revenue_success.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revenue Success" /><published>2023-05-08T01:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-08T01:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://www.rejniak.com/revenue_success/2023/05/08/revenue_success</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rejniak.com/revenue_success/2023/05/08/revenue_success.html"><![CDATA[<p>It is time to start thinking about revenue operations and revenue enablement as a single function.

<p>At first glance, one could argue that McMahon should have called The Qualified Sales Leader‚Äôs opening chapter The QBR. However, ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù is quite right: The quarterly business review is indeed the perfect <em>introduction</em> to the sales and leadership challenges that McMahon explores for the reader throughout the book‚Äôs subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>It was in this first chapter where I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs ops? Where‚Äôs enablement? What‚Äôs the data?‚Äù Setting up the meeting environment, we read that, in addition to the author‚Äôs presence as a consultant, the CEO, the CRO, sales leaders, and reps are present in the room, but no mention of ops or enablement players. Fair enough, it‚Äôs not the focus of the book. I suspect, that in McMahon‚Äôs real world, there‚Äôs ops and enablement folks present. However, in my experience, I‚Äôve seen plenty of QBRs go down just like that, with no ops and enablement participants. It‚Äôs a mistake. So, here we are.</p>

<p>Ops/enablement lesson number one. Be present in the QBR‚Äìemphasis on ‚Äúbe present.‚Äù Don‚Äôt just attend. Listen deeply and actively. Participate. You are a critically important participant in this event. More than likely, you and your team participated in preparing for the QBR. Use this event as a feedback loop to your work. Which artifacts, i.e., data, charts, analysis, were impactful and which ones were wasted effort? What questions couldn‚Äôt be readily answered? Were they the result of something missing from the artifacts or tools? Or, were the they simply from a lack of preparation? For those unanswered questions, were they meaningful, actionable, and insightful to the deal in question? Actively identify the gaps in sales process understanding and application. Ask your own clarifying questions that test whether or not everyone understands the meaning of the trade language, the lingo, in the same way. Look at the relationship dynamics between leaders, managers, and reps.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre watching a series of ‚Äústump the chump‚Äù episodes, something is broken in the QBR process. McMahon describes a proper QBR as a learning and coaching session. It should be an event where reps can learn from the experience in the room, from their peers and their leaders. It should also deliver on an accurate view on the deal priorities in the quarter ahead so that action can be taken to both course correct and drive to a successful outcome. The same applies to ops and enablement leaders. This is an event to learn from your peers and your most important stakeholders. It‚Äôs an opportunity to identify gaps in learning, tools, and processes.</p>

<p>Consider the following action items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Institute a required pre-read for all presenting reps to allow for preparation. Like any meeting, the best ones are the ones in which everyone comes prepared. The pre-read need not be exhaustive. In fact, I‚Äôd argue for the contrary. Instead presenters can focus on the facts scaffolded by your flavor of MEDDICC with the necessary deals that ‚Äúwalk‚Äù to their number. As we‚Äôll explore later, most of this should be able to come out of your CRM.</li>
  <li>After the meeting, deliver a readout to your revenue leaders. This is your analysis and insights into what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and what prioritized ops and enablement opportunities you‚Äôre taking away for action this quarter. These shouldn‚Äôt derail your strategic ops and enablement roadmaps (you do have your strategically-aligned roadmap, right?), but rather initiatives and tasks that you can accomplish ahead of and to impact the next QBR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this is just an introduction. There‚Äôs a ton of details and lessons within The Qualified Sales Leader to reencode for ops and enablement leaders that culminate into your own QBR performance. In the upcoming 56 chapters, just like McMahon transforms the sales characters of his book, we‚Äôll unpack his lessons to align you to your sales leadership and equip you as an ops and enablement leader to fully participate in the QBR‚Äìand beyond.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="qsl_for_revsuccess" /><category term="revenue_success" /><category term="sales" /><category term="revenue" /><category term="gtm" /><category term="qsl" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Revenue Success &amp;amp; The QSL: Getting Started</title><link href="https://www.rejniak.com/qsl_for_revsuccess/2023/01/07/qsl-getting-started.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revenue Success &amp;amp; The QSL: Getting Started" /><published>2023-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-01-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://www.rejniak.com/qsl_for_revsuccess/2023/01/07/qsl-getting-started</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rejniak.com/qsl_for_revsuccess/2023/01/07/qsl-getting-started.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="operations-and-enablement-reflections-on-the-qualified-sales-leader">Operations and Enablement Reflections on <em>The Qualified Sales Leader</em></h2>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p><em>The Qualified Sales Leader</em> (QSL) by John McMahon provides an education on motivating sales success through a ton of colorful, pointed anecdotes to deliver wisdom and ‚Äúlessons from a five time CRO.‚Äù Although the book is focused on managers and leaders, it is, of course, a valuable read for the individual contributor as well as the operations and enablement practitioner. I won‚Äôt rehash <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=qualified+sales+leader+summary">overviews</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qualified-Sales-Leader-Proven-Lessons/dp/0578895064#customerReviews">reviews</a> of the QSL. Rather, allow me to introduce the this project and its objectives.</p>

<p>The QSL is the sales manual of our time.</p>

<h4 id="the-project">The Project</h4>
<p>As the the focus of the book is on creating successful software sales teams, I would argue that at the very core of that success‚Äìand, really, at the heart of the QSL‚Äìis a specialized alignment from CEO to rep, and with every role in between, on process and language. I would further argue that in the real world execution of those processes and implementation of that language, that operations and enablement is key to scale of any size. Finally, I argue that the most critical element of an effective operations and enablement organization is data.</p>

<p>(I should add an aside re: the importance of data in ops and enablement, with a main theme about adaptation, evolution through data ‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>Therefore, this project will identify ways for operations and enablement teams to support a qualified sales organization, especially where data plays a key role. We will work through the QSL chapter-by-chapter unpacking the lessons from the book for actionable insights and tactics that operations and enablement leaders and practitioners can use to help their sales organizations grow.</p>

<p>An aside.
I propose that the operations and enablement functions need to be considered a singular function. I propose that we start to think about <a href="/revenue_success/2023/05/08/revenue_success.html">Revenue Success</a>. In the installments that follow, rather than refer to ‚Äúops and enablement,‚Äù I will simply refer to ‚Äúrev success.‚Äù</p>

<p>I‚Äôm simply working to add to the discourse to improve selling. Of course, like any idea, like the entire body of human knowledge, it‚Äôs a work in progress. And that progress needs your input. Please provide your feedback in the comments or send an email to mick@rejniak.com.</p>

<h5 id="about-me">About me</h5>
<p>I‚Äôm a GTM data scientist. As I‚Äôm writing this, I have about 15 years of experience as enterprise SaaS sales operations and enablement leader.

<h3 id="an-operators-companion-to-the-qualified-sales-leader">An Operator‚Äôs Companion to The Qualified Sales Leader</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmcmahon1/">John McMahon‚Äôs</a> recent hit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qualified-Sales-Leader-Proven-Lessons/dp/0578895064"><em>The Qualified Sales Leader: Proven Lessons From a Five-Time CRO</em></a> codifies the seller and sales leader wisdom he developed while serving as CRO at PTC, Geo-Tel, Ariba, BladeLogic, and BMC. The book illuminates the perils and pearls of a modern-day, enterprise-software seller, from QBR to Closed.</p>

<p>I will provide a chapter-by-chapter interpretration of <em>The Qualified Sales Leader</em> from an operations and enablement perspective. I‚Äôll attempt to create an operator‚Äôs companion to help the massive operations and enablement community to better align with and support the field‚Äôs motion.</p>

<p>With 57 chapters across five parts, I‚Äôm thinking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reflect on two chapters a week (occassionally more; some chapters are a page or two)</li>
  <li>Post the content on LinkedIn in hopes of generating discussion and feedback</li>
  <li>Complete in about six months (in parallel with work and last term of school)</li>
  <li>Edit and compile version one a month or so later</li>
</ul>
